##### A visualization project done on the course [DH2321 _Information and Visualization_](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2321)

### Motivation

This project is was created with the purpose to aid the Director of Studies at the Media Technology department at the Royal Intstitute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. As Director of studies, one of the tasks is to allocate teacher assets so that each course given by the school the coming year is properly staffed. This process has thus far been documented in spreadsheets, where, although each entry resides at a logical position.

This project visialized this data with the goal to get an better overview and help with the workflow of this data.
